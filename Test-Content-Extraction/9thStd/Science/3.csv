Answer Briefly,What is meant by electric current?,NA,Electric current is defined as the rate of flow of electric charges through a conductor.
Answer Briefly,State Ohm's law.,NA,The potential difference (V) across a conductor is directly proportional to the current (I) flowing through it at constant temperature.
Answer Briefly,What are the factors affecting resistance of a conductor?,NA,The resistance of a conductor depends on: 1. Length of the conductor 2. Area of cross-section 3. Nature of the material 4. Temperature of the conductor
Answer Briefly,What is the role of a resistor in an electric circuit?,NA,A resistor is used to control the current flow in an electric circuit by offering resistance to the flow of electric charges.
