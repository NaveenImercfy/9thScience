It is the displacement in unit time.{next}Distinguish distance and displacement.{ans}Distance: The actual length of the path travelled by a moving body irrespective of the direction (Scalar quantity). Displacement: The change in position of a moving body in a particular direction (Vector quantity).{next}What do you mean by uniform-motion?{ans}An object is said to be in uniform motion if it covers equal distances in equal intervals of time how so ever big or small these time intervals may be.{next}Compare speed and velocity.{ans}Speed is scalar quantity measuring distance covered per unit time. Velocity is vector quantity measuring displacement per unit time.
