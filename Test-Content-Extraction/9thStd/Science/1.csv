Fill in the blanks,Speed is a _______ quantity whereas velocity is a _______ quantity.,NA,Scalar Vector
Fill in the blanks,The slope of the distance – time graph at any point gives _______,NA,Speed
Fill in the blanks,Negative acceleration is called _______,NA,retardation (or) deceleration
Fill in the blanks,Area under velocity – time graph shows _______,NA,displacement
True or False,The motion of a city bus in a heavy traffic road is an example for uniform motion.,NA,False
True or False,Acceleration can get negative value also.,NA,True
True or False,Distance covered by a particle never becomes zero but displacement becomes zero.,NA,True
True or False,The velocity – time graph of a particle falling freely under gravity would be a straight line parallel to the x axis.,NA,False
True or False,If the velocity – time graph of a particle is a straight line inclined to X-axis then its displacement – time graph will be a straight line.,NA,True
Answer Briefly,Define velocity.,NA,Velocity is the rate of change of displacement. It is the displacement in unit time.
Answer Briefly,Distinguish distance and displacement.,NA,Distance: The actual length of the path travelled by a moving body irrespective of the direction (Scalar quantity). Displacement: The change in position of a moving body in a particular direction (Vector quantity).
Answer Briefly,What do you mean by uniform-motion?,NA,An object is said to be in uniform motion if it covers equal distances in equal intervals of time how so ever big or small these time intervals may be.
Answer Briefly,Compare speed and velocity.,NA,Speed is scalar quantity measuring distance covered per unit time. Velocity is vector quantity measuring displacement per unit time.
