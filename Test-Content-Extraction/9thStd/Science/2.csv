True or False,Liquids are highly compressible.,NA,False
True or False,The pressure at a depth depends on the nature of liquid.,NA,True
True or False,The weight of an object appears to be less when immersed in a liquid.,NA,True
Answer Briefly,Define pressure.,NA,Pressure is defined as the force acting per unit area of a surface.
Answer Briefly,State Pascal's law.,NA,The pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally in all directions throughout the fluid.
Answer Briefly,What is atmospheric pressure?,NA,The pressure exerted by the weight of air column on the Earth's surface is called atmospheric pressure.
Answer Briefly,Why does a helium balloon float in air?,NA,A helium balloon floats in air because the density of helium is less than the density of air. The buoyant force acting on the balloon is greater than its weight.
